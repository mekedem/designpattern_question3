question 3

The pattern chosen to implement the question is the composite pattern. 
The reason we chose the pattern is because itâ€™s used to represent tree like 
structures between more or less the same types of objects. The employees 
attribute in an employee object can be thought of as branches in a tree 
structure where the root for those branches is the employee object in which 
they reside. The same goes for the other employees that might be found inside 
the employees attributes of each branch employees.

This pattern also makes it very easy to compute collective salary of employees 
under a particular employee by using efficient tree traversal algorithms.
